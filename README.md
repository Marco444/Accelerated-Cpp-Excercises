# Accelerated-Cpp-Excercises
The solution to the excercises provided by the awesome book "Accelerated C++", Work in progress.
The code excercises are the greatest aid to get better at programming, please strongly consider doing them before checking the answers

Keep in mind that the code solutions are not necessarily completely tested and some of them may even be unfinished or poorly written; in which case, I would encourage anyone who has a better solution to post it. Moreover, I intend this "solutions" to be only a guide that you can use to more easily solve the problems.
